    <h1>Hello, I’m Ann.</h1>
    <p>I have many years of experience as a <i>Print-media Production Artist</i>. I know InDesign fairly well, and I used to be nearly expert-level in Quark Xpress (however, not having used it in years, I’m definitely rusty!). I’m trying to learn coding and Web Design to be able to enhance my resume, and make myself more marketable and thus employable. I’m passionate about learning, and I truly feel that I could successfully translate my page-layout skills into the Web medium. I’ve had a Web Tutor for about a year now and I have already learned a little about coding and other things from her; thus I now feel I'm ready for a class.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of my other main passions in life is animal-rights; particularly dog-rescue. I am a volunteer foster-mom with the rescue-group <b>Foster2Home</b>. F2H has existed for four years, and has already saved over 1,000 dogs. I am proud to be a part of this mission!!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Here are several dogs I have fostered until they found their fur-ever homes:</h3>
